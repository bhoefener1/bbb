        <strong>Stretching/ Strengthening</strong>
      </header>
      <p>
        keeps your body going by using the majority of the muscles that are
        not usually touched by a person's average routine, this way they do
        not decrease into atrophy. It also lengthens the muscles that are
        consistently shortened throughout the day. Example: Your hamstrings-
        if you sit at all- you are shortening the distance from your knee to
        your pelvis. If your body does not lengthen this muscle it will
        continuously shorten, this is one of a few elements involved with low
        back pain. Go to the <a
          href="http://bodyworksbybarb.blogspot.com/search/label/stretch-and-strengthen">
          stretch and strengthen</a> section of my newsletters page.
        Strengthening is also just as important because as there are tight
        strong muscles in your body there are tight weak muscles there as
        well.  You need to have a balance or your body will be compensate,
        which will lead to your pain. A good example of this is the upper leg
        with knee problems. Most people have strong quadriceps and outer
        thigh, with weak hamstrings and inner thigh. This makes it so every
        step taken tracks the knee to the outer side of the leg, making your
        knee hurt after some walking/ running, it may even develop slight
        inflammation.
