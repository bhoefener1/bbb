      <h1>Chair Massage</h1>
      <h3>In the Corporate setting:</h3>

      <p>I will come into your place of business and work on your employees for
      ten to twenty minutes in a massage chair. You stay fully dressed.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Release stress and tension to employees</li>

        <li>Show the employees that their company does care for them</li>

        <li>Provide a wonderful thank you or reward for a fantastic job</li>

        <li>Improves the morale of the company</li>

        <li>People start thinking healthier, meaning they will be at work
        more</li>

        <li>Increases productivity</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>At other locations- including schools, weddings, Bridal Showers, or
      charity events (including golf courses and races)</h3>

      <p>I will set up anywhere you wish and provide chair massage (5-20 min
      depending) and either charge per person or a total for the group. If I
      work with a charity I will charge a small amount per person and give half
      of the profits to the charity.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Another event to provide during a specific function or expo</li>

        <li>Extra support for over-whelming stress times</li>

        <li>Very specialized, unique gift that will not be forgotten</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Contact me if there are any questions or you happen to think of any
        other event that my services would be nice to have, I will be glad to
        discuss any ideas you may have.</h3>
