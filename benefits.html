      <h1>Benefits of Massage</h1>

      <p>Massage gives you a roadmap of stress areas in your body. Many times
      people don&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t know how much stress they are carrying
      until they receive a massage; then they are able to feel their tensions
      and let go of their stress. As the massage therapist stretches and
      loosens muscles and connective tissues, stress and muscular tension are
      released.</p>

      <p>Once you have an awareness of where stress lodges in your body, you
      can begin to do something about it. You start to educate yourself and
      your body, and you reverse a negative cycle by incorporating stretching,
      massage, water, and watching your posture on an everyday basis.</p>

      <p>Neuromuscular Massage, which is often used for injuries and conditions
      of pain, works at softening the muscles so that the therapist can come in
      more deeply to break up adhesions. This allows muscles to become really
      elastic, the way they should be. The body then may be freed of spasm and
      pain, increase its range of motion, and have the ability to avoid
      injury.</p>
