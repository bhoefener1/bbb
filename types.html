      <h1>Types of Massage</h1>

      <h4 class="alt">I will generally use a combination of all these techniques.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="color:green">Neuro-Muscular Therapy:</span> Specific work on a particular muscle, usually deep.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green">Deep Tissue:</span> Going beyond the first layers of skin into the muscle, usually long strokes.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green">Swedish:</span> Long, gentle stokes along the body with in the first few layers of skin, used for relaxation.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green">Myo-fascial Release:</span> Separating the top layer of skin from the underlying tissue.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green">Reflexology:</span> Working with the body’s systems on the foot itself.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green">Stretching & Exercises:</span> Learn techniques for stretching problem “strong” muscles; along with strengthening problem “weak” muscles. To be done daily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="alt">These are other special therapies that I can use:</h4>

      <dl>
        <dt>Hot Stone Massage</dt>
        <dd>Use of heated, smooth stones to help release tight muscles; very
        relaxing.  The heat makes it so I do not need to go as deep to
        accomplish the same effect and usually works faster</dd>

        <dt>Pregnancy Massage</dt>
        <dd>Please check with your doctor!</dd>

        <dt>Stretch/ Thai  Massage</dt>
        <dd>Keeping your clothes on, I will stretch every major muscle in the
        body using passive and active assisted stretching.</dd>

        <dt>Stretching and Strengthening Instruction</dt>
        <dd>Learn how to balance out your own muscles by doing some simple
        exercises 1-2 times a day, for 20 seconds each.</dd>

        <dt>DETOX Ionic Footbath:</dt>
        <dd>This is a thirty minute footbath that draws toxins out of the
        entire body by using negative and positively charged poles, along with
        salt to help the process.  It does not feel like anything while the
        therapy is going on, if you were to look into the tub that your feet
        are in, you would see it be very dirty- these are your individual
        toxins.  When the footbath is completed, the recipient feels anew, with
        more energy and a general feeling of being clean.</dd>

        <dt>Chair Massage</dt>
        <dd>For the office or Pamper Parties.  You keep your clothes on for
        10-20 minutes. Please go to the <a href="chairmassage.html">chair
          massage page</a>.</dd>
