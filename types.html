      <h1>Types of Massage</h1>

      <h4 class="alt">I will generally use a combination of all these techniques.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Neuro-Muscular Therapy:</span> Specific work on a particular muscle, usually deep.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Deep Tissue:</span> Going beyond the first layers of skin into the muscle, usually long strokes.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Swedish:</span> Long, gentle stokes along the body with in the first few layers of skin, used for relaxation.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Myo-fascial Release:</span> Separating the top layer of skin from the underlying tissue.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Reflexology:</span> Working with the body’s systems on the foot itself.</li>
        <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Stretching & Exercises:</span> Learn techniques for stretching problem “strong” muscles; along with strengthening problem “weak” muscles. To be done daily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="alt">These are other special therapies that I can use:</h4>

      <dl>
        <dt><span style="color:green">Hot Stone Massage</span></dt>
        <dd>Use of heated, smooth stones to help release tight muscles; very
        relaxing.  The heat makes it so I do not need to go as deep to
        accomplish the same effect and usually works faster</dd>

        <dt><span style="color:green">Elderly Massage</span></dt>
        <dd>If you cannot come to me, I will come to you and use your bed or whatever is comfortable for you.</dd>

        <dt><span style="color:green">Disabled/ Physically Handicapped Massage</span></dt>
	<dd>I will come to you, we will work however comprotable for you, being in a wheelchair, bed or other location.  I tend to focus on stretching and getting better range of motion, with some soothing massage. You tell me what your body responds to best. </dd>

        <dt><span style="color:green">Pregnancy Massage</span></dt>
        <dd>Please check with your doctor!  Relax those low back muscles and get rid of some pain, or lets help to induce labor.</dd>

        <dt><span style="color:green">Stretch/ Thai Massage</span></dt>
        <dd>Keeping your clothes on, I will stretch every major muscle in the
        body using passive and active assisted stretching.  I can also add some stretching techniques to the massage.</dd>

        <dt><span style="color:green">Stretching and Strengthening
          Instruction</span></dt>
        <dd>Learn how to balance out your own muscles by doing some simple
        exercises 1-2 times a day, for 20 seconds each.</dd>

        <dt><span style="color:green">Chair Massage</span></dt>
        <dd>For the office or Pamper Parties.  You keep your clothes on for a mini massage break away from it all.
        Please go to the <a href="chairmassage.html">chair
          massage page</a>.</dd>
