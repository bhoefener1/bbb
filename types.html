      <h1>Types of Massage</h1>

      <p>I will generally use a combination of all these techniques.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neuro-Muscular Therapy: Specific work on a particular muscle, usually deep.</li>
        <li>Deep Tissue: Going beyond the first layers of skin into the muscle, usually long strokes.</li>
        <li>Swedish: Long, gentle stokes along the body with in the first few layers of skin, used for relaxation.</li>
        <li>Myo-fascial Release: Separating the top layer of skin from the underlying tissue.</li>
        <li>Reflexology: Working with the body’s systems on the foot itself.</li>
        <li>Stretching & Exercises: Learn techniques for stretching problem “strong” muscles; along with strengthening problem “weak” muscles. To be done daily.</li>
      </ul>
