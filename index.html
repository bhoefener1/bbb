      <h3>Other Important Elements:</h3>

      <p>During a session I explain to my clients the importance of
      stretching/ strengthening, posture, and water.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Stetching/ Strengthening</strong> keeps your body going by
      using the majority of the muscles that are not usually touched by a
      person's average routine, this way they do not decrease into atrophy.
      It also lengthens the muscles that are consistently shortened
      throughout the day. Example: Your hamstrings- if you sit at all- you
      are shortening the distance from your knee to your pelvis. If your body
      does not lengthen this muscle it will continuously shorten, this is one
      of a few elements involved with low back pain. Go to the stretch and
      strengthen section of my <a href="blog.html">blog</a>.  Strengthening
      is also just as important because as there are tight strong muscles in
      your body there are tight weak muscles there as well. You need to have
      a balance or your body will be compensate, which will lead to your
      pain. A good example of this is the upper leg with knee problems. Most
      people have strong quadriceps and outer thigh, with weak hamstrings and
      inner thigh. This makes it so every step taken tracks the knee to the
      outer side of the leg, making your knee hurt after some walking/
      running, it may even develop slight inflammation.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Posture</strong> tells your body where the muscles and bones
      should be. The body is a wonderful organism, it will adapt to whatever
      you put yourself through, including posture. As most of you know the
      majority of peoples postures are awful, mainly including rounding of
      shoulders- which creates a pain in the upper back and neck area, this is
      because the upper back is overstretched and the chest area is concaved,
      where the body eats up this extra slack and now is tight, best way to fix
      this is stretch out the pec muscle between a doorway, and buildup the
      upper back by squeezing the shoulder blades together, a good exercise is
      the rowing machine. Another common problem is low-back pain, caused by
      many problems, the easiest to solve is by not sitting on a wallet,
      crossing your legs, sitting on your foot, or chronically holding weight
      on one side of your hip- ex. a child, instead try to hold the child in
      the center of your body as often as possible and decrease the amount of
      times you pick up a heavy package or baby.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Water</strong> is essential for your bodies' vitality and
      function. For your body to function at its highest it must be hydrated by
      at least seventy percent. The organs and tissues in your body can produce
      about twenty percent, which means that you MUST put in the other fifty
      percent, which goes the saying half your body weight in ounces. Ex. a
      person weights 200 lbs, they must drink 100 oz of water and increase that
      water count if: drink coffee, (non-herbal) tea, alcohol, soda, or
      exercise; because these five things dehydrate you. Basically meaning the
      average person should be drinking about a gallon a day, which is not that
      hard, the secret: always have water available to you.</p><br>

      <h3>Chair Massage:</h3>

      <p><a href="chairmassage.html">Chair Massage</a> is a great mini escape
      from the stressful world to help loosen up shoulders and neck. It helps
      to refresh the recipient to continue their day happier and with energy.
      Chair is done on-site such as an office, wedding, social gathering,
      charity event, or any place where people could use a mini escape from the
      day.</p>
