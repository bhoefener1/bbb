    <p><strong>Other Important Elements:</strong></p>
    <p>During a session I explain to my clients the importance of stretching/ strengthening, posture, and water. </p>
    <p><strong>Stretching/ Strengthening </strong>keeps your body alive by using the majority of the muscles that are not usually touched by a personâ€™s average routine, this way they do not decrease into atrophy.  It also lengthens the muscles that are consistently shortened throughout the day.  Example:  Your hamstrings- if you sit at all- you are shortening the distance from your knee to your pelvis.  If your body does not lengthen this muscle it will continuously shorten, this is one of a few elements involved with low back pain.  Go to the <a href="http://www.student.gsu.edu/~bhoefener1/bodyworksbybarb/Stretching.htm">stretching</a> page.   Strengthening is also just as important because as there are tight strong muscles in your body there are tight weak muscles there as well.  You need to have a balance or your body will be compensate, which will lead to your pain.  A good example of this is the upper leg with knee problems.  Most people have strong quadriceps and outer thigh, with weak hamstrings and inner thigh.  This makes it so every step taken tracks the knee to the outer side of the leg, making your knee hurt after some walking/ running, it may even develop slight inflammation.</p>
    <p><strong>Posture </strong>tells your body where the muscles and bones should be. The body is a wonderful organism, it will adapt to whatever you put yourself through, including posture. As most of you know the majority of peoples postures are awful, mainly including rounding of shoulders- which creates a pain in the upper back and neck area, this is because the upper back is overstretched and the chest area is concaved, where the body eats up this extra slack and now is tight, best way to fix this is stretch out the pec muscle between a doorway, and buildup the upper back by squeezing the shoulder blades together, a good exercise is the rowing machine. Another common problem is low-back pain, caused by many problems, the easiest to solve is by not sitting on a wallet, crossing your legs, sitting on your foot, or chronically holding weight on one side of your hip- ex. a child, instead try to hold the child in the center of your body as often as possible and decrease the amount of times you pick up a heavy package or baby.</p>
    <p><strong>Water </strong>is essential for your bodies' vitality and function. For your body to function at its highest it must be hydrated by at least seventy percent. The organs and tissues in your body can produce about twenty percent, which means that you MUST put in the other fifty percent, which goes the saying half your body weight in ounces. Ex. a person weights 200 lbs, they must drink 100 oz of water and increase that water count if: drink coffee, (non-herbal) tea, alcohol, soda, or exercise; because these five things dehydrate you. Basically meaning the average person should be drinking about a gallon a day, which is not that hard, the secret: always have water available to you, preferably in your hands.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Chair Massage:</strong></p>
    <p>Chair Massage is a great mini escape from the stressful world to help loosen up shoulders and neck.  Also refresh the recipient to continue their day happier and with energy.  Chair is done on-site such as an OFFICE, WEDDING, SOCAIL GATHERING, CHARITY EVENT, or any place where people could use a MINI ESCAPE from the day.  The person who hires me can receive a FREE massage at my office.</p>
