      <p style="font-size:120%"><strong>About Me</strong><p>
      <ul>
        <li>I graduated from Rising Spirit massage school in 2003; I have had my
        own office since the start of school (2002).</li>
        <li>I supervise clinic and teach at RSI (both campuses) along with Gwinnett
        College.  My favorite class to teach is Rehabilitation from injury.  Keep
        in mind that it took more than one day to get you in my office, so it may
        take more than 1 hour to ‘fix’ you.</li>
        <li> I have my Bachelors in Exercise Science, which makes me a glorified
        personal trainer, along with other abilities.  This just adds to the
        stretching and strengthening exercises I will assign for you, for you to
        help your body daily.</li>
        <li>I have worked with children and adults with disabilities since I was 17 years old,
        and love it.  This exposed me to physical therapy, occupational therapy,
        and speech therapy.  I know how to do a lot of it, so it gets
        incorporated into the massage and how you should take care of yourself once you leave the office.  This means that stretching and strengthening
        in the correct muscles to create a balance is key to your success of
        having a happy body.  Water and posture also play a very important
        role.</li>
        <li>I believe play is just as important as work- so when I am not working
        or at school, I will be at the barn riding horses or dancing (swing,
        country, or ballroom)</li>
        <li>I spend lots of time volunteering with children with disabilities (MS,
        MD, DS, Autism, CP) doing Hippo-therapy.  I also work on adults with
        Spinal Cord Injuries and Brain Injuries at the Shepherd Center.  This is
        some of my favorite work.</li>
