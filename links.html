      <p>This is a great place to work out and as a bonus learn some
      self-defense. I support them because every instructor uses the correct
      body mechanics, and makes you do so also.  This means that they walk
      around and watch you perform whatever it is they are teaching you for
      the hour session.  This is a medium- high intensity workout (of course
      you can step out/ sit down if it is too much), if you are not sure,
      talk to me.  Their first class is free. <a
